Loot Master - An easy to use loot manager for your tabletop adventures.
  
**Important Note**  
Everything is very much subject to change, this is also why there aren't many, if any, comments within the code  
Please excuse this very messy beginning, this project is still pretty much in its infancy  
  
## (Planned) Features  
- Inventory for Party, Players and Consumables
