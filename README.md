# LooM  - Loot Master for DnD, Pathfinder and More!
Loot Master - An easy to use loot manager for your tabletop adventures.
  
**Important Note**  
The program currently does not allow to be compiled from Github due to the lack of the database package.  
This package has been omitted to prevent leaking the database login information. I'm still on the lookout for a better solution.
  
## (Planned) Features  
- Inventory for Party, Players and Consumables  
- Automatic moving of loot to player inventories on claim  
- Loot can be marked as Story, Sell, Sell 1/2, or No Sell
- Story loot won't be sell-able or claimable
- Potions, Wands, Scrolls, and similar will be automatically sorted into Consumables  
- Consumables have automatic counters and an easy way of reducing or increasing their numbers  
- Bank Tab which keeps track of the incoming money and each players income  
- Party Bank from which can automatically be drawn or added to easily
- Selling will be fully automatic for all items with a value assigned  
- Customizable percentages of gold distribution, with presets for "Players evenly, Party 0%" and "Players + Party evenly"  
- Toggle for "count claimed equipment against gold distribution" and  "count claimed consumables against gold distribution"
